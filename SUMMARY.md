## 📊 AI Algorithm Explanation (Summary)

### Minimax Algorithm
The AI explores all possible future game states in a tree structure, assuming both players play optimally. It "maximizes" its own advantage while "minimizing" yours.

**Analogy**: Like chess players thinking "if I move here, they'll move there, then I'll move here..."

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
An optimization that skips branches of the game tree that can't affect the final decision, making the search ~10x faster.

**Analogy**: If you're shopping for the best price and Store A has $500, you don't need to check Store B if their worst price is $600.

### Position Evaluation
The AI scores each board position considering:
- **Piece count difference (×100)**: Material advantage
- **Mobility (×2)**: Number of legal moves
- **Board presence**: Pieces placed vs in hand
- **Win/loss (±10,000)**: Immediate victory/defeat

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Depth 1, 50% random moves
- **Medium**: Depth 3 with alpha-beta pruning
- **Hard**: Depth 5 with alpha-beta pruning
