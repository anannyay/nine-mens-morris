### Card 2: Three Phases
Breaks down the game into its three distinct phases:
- **Placing**: Deploy your 9 pieces

Each card uses bullet points for easy scanning and includes strategic advice.

## ðŸ¤– AI Explanation Screen

This is where the magic happens! Four detailed cards explain exactly how the AI thinks:

### Card 1: Minimax Algorithm
```
â€¢ Searches future game states
â€¢ Assumes optimal opponent play
â€¢ Evaluates positions recursively
â€¢ Maximizes AI advantage
â€¢ Minimizes your advantage

Depth = moves ahead to analyze
```

**Simple Explanation**: Like planning chess moves, the AI looks ahead several turns, imagining all possible moves by both players, then chooses the path that gives it the best position.

### Card 2: Alpha-Beta Pruning
```
â€¢ Optimization technique
â€¢ Skips irrelevant branches
â€¢ Same result, faster search
â€¢ Enables deeper analysis
â€¢ Used in Medium/Hard modes

Can search 10x faster!
```

**Simple Explanation**: Imagine you're shopping for the best price. If store 1 has $100 and store 2's worst price is $150, you don't need to check store 2's other items. The AI does this with move trees.

### Card 3: Position Evaluation
```
Heuristic function considers:
â€¢ Piece count difference (Ã—100)
â€¢ Mobility (legal moves) (Ã—2)
â€¢ Pieces on board vs hand
â€¢ Win/loss states (Â±10,000)

Balances material & strategy
```

**Simple Explanation**: The AI scores each board position like a judge scores a performance, considering multiple factors to determine who's ahead.

### Card 4: Difficulty Levels
```
EASY: Depth 1, 50% random
  Fast, makes mistakes

MEDIUM: Depth 3, alpha-beta
  Solid tactical play

HARD: Depth 5, alpha-beta
  Strong strategic planning
```
